# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Symfony UX website!

The ux.symfony.com website is an open source, community-driven project, and we are happy to receive contributions from the community!

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to read the [Symfony's Contribution Guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) first

## Reporting an issue

If you find a bug on the website, have a feature request, or need help/have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/symfony/ux.symfony.com/issues/new).

For issues related to the Symfony UX packages themselves (not the website), please use [the symfony/ux repository](https://github.com/symfony/ux/issues/new/choose) instead.

Please provide as much information as possible, and remember to follow our
[Code of Conduct](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code_of_conduct/index.html)
to ensure a friendly environment for all contributors.
